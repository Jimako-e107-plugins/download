# download

This is core download plugin with some changes.  It is my playground version only.  


## This is a custom version, but don't use if you don't know what are you doing, We accept no liability, always make a backup of your existing website!

This repository was created to address certain issues encountered in real-world website use. It is public, so feel free to draw inspiration, use the code, or contribute to fixing the core version—or simply fix the core version yourself!

I have to admit, I'm not a fan of the phrase "Just create a PR." Years ago, I spent weeks working on issues, fixes, and answering questions related to a download plugin, only to be met with silence and no response. Never again.

In 2024, I decided to abandon my UnitedNuke version. At the beginning of 2025, I migrated the content to the e107 version. That’s when my “nightmare” began. Unfortunately, there’s no turning back, so I have to continue working with this plugin.



## 2025 Most important changes 

- moved plugin preferences from core to plugin preferences (data)

- moved limits from generic table to plugin preferences
